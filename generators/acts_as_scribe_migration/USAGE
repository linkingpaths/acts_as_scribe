Description:
    The migration generator creates a migration to add the activities table to your database and takes no arguments.

Example:
    ./script/generate acts_as_scribe_migration
	
	Migration:  db/migrate/add_activities_table.rb
	The Activity model lives in the lib directory of this plugin. You can move that model into your models directory and modify it if you like.
