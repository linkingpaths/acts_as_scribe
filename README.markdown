Install
-------
 
 * Run the following command:
 
 `script/plugin install git://github.com/linkingpaths/acts_as_scribe.git`
 
 * Generate the tables via the given generator:

 `script/generate acts_as_scribe_migration`

Record activities in your models
---------------------------------------------
 
<pre>
  class Comment < ActiveRecord::Base    
    record_activity_of :user
  end
</pre>
You can use any association that is related to an user:
<pre>
  class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
    belongs_to :author, :class_name => "User"
    record_activity_of :author
  end
</pre>

This will register automatically a new activity when you create or destroy a new record. If you want control over the activities registration based on your model's state just use the :if option

<pre>
  class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
    belongs_to :author, :class_name => "User"
    record_activity_of :author, :if => Proc.new { |post| post.private == false }
  end
</pre>

If you record activities different than the default create and destroy you can specify the :actions option

<pre>
  class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
    belongs_to :author, :class_name => "User"
    record_activity_of :author, :actions => [:create, :update, :destroy]
  end
</pre>


Record activities without related item
--------------------------------------

If you want to record activities not related to any specific model just use `Activity.report` in your code:
<pre>
  def grant_admin(user)
    user.admin = true
    Activity.report(current_user, :grant_admin, user)
  end
</pre>
If the action is not related to any item, just don't use it.
<pre>
  def login
    current_user = User.find(â€¦)
    Activity.report(current_user, :login)
  end
</pre>
